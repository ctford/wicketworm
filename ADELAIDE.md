### England 1st Innings: Yet to bat

## Match Summary (So Far)

Australia leads 2-0 in the series and won the toss, electing to bat first at Adelaide Oval. A dramatic first day saw Australia recover from a mid-innings collapse (94/4) to reach 344/8, powered by a maiden Ashes century from Alex Carey and a solid 82 from recalled veteran Usman Khawaja.

## Day 1 - Tuesday, December 17, 2025

**Morning Session:**
Australia won the toss and chose to bat first in sweltering Adelaide heat. The decision looked questionable early as England's pace attack struck twice in quick succession. Jake Weatherald (8.2 overs) and Travis Head (9.1 overs) both fell with the score on 33, leaving Australia 33/2.

Usman Khawaja, making an unexpected return to the Test side, steadied the ship alongside Marnus Labuschagne. However, just as a recovery seemed underway, disaster struck.

**Afternoon Session:**
A dramatic collapse saw Australia lose both set batsmen in quick succession at 94. Marnus Labuschague fell for a modest score at 24.1 overs, immediately followed by Cameron Green at 24.3 overs. Australia were reeling at 94/4, and England sensed an opportunity to restrict the hosts to a modest total.

**Tea to Stumps:**
This is where Alex Carey's innings turned the match. Coming in with his team in trouble, Carey joined forces with the recalled Usman Khawaja to produce a crucial 91-run partnership. Khawaja played the anchor role perfectly, scoring 82 off 126 balls with 10 boundaries before falling at 185/5 after 47.2 overs.

Josh Inglis (60.5 overs) and captain Pat Cummins (65.5 overs) provided support, but it was Carey's day. Despite a controversial DRS Snicko incident (technology provider later accepted responsibility for an error that may have cost England his wicket), Carey went on to score his maiden Ashes century - 106 off 143 balls with 8 fours and 1 six.

Even after Carey's dismissal at 321/8 (77.2 overs), Mitchell Starc (33* off 63 balls) and Nathan Lyon (0* off 12 balls) added valuable runs to take Australia to a respectable position.

**Close of Play:** Australia 344/8 (85 overs)

**Key Highlights:**
- **Record crowd:** 56,298 attended Day 1, a cricket record for Adelaide Oval
- **Temperature:** Play conducted in extreme heat, reaching 39°C

## Day 2 - Wednesday, December 18, 2025 (IN PROGRESS)
