## Match Summary

An astonishing Test match that finished inside two days, with 40 wickets falling in just 198.2 overs. The match swung dramatically with Mitchell Starc's devastating first innings spell and Travis Head's blistering century sealing Australia's victory.

## Day 1 - November 21, 2025

**Morning Session:**
England won the toss and elected to bat first at Perth Stadium. The decision backfired as Mitchell Starc ran riot with the new ball, exploiting the pace and bounce of the Perth pitch. England were reduced to 87/5 before lunch, with only Harry Brook showing resistance.

**Afternoon Session:**
Harry Brook (52) and Ollie Pope (46) added some respectability to the total with a 69-run partnership for the 6th wicket. However, Starc returned to clean up the tail, finishing with career-best figures of 7/58 as England were dismissed for 172.

**Evening Session:**
Australia's reply was equally fragile. Ben Stokes produced a masterful spell of reverse swing, taking 5/23 as Australia slumped to 132 all out. England held a 40-run first-innings lead at stumps with 19 wickets falling on an extraordinary opening day.

**Close of Play:** Australia 132 all out (40-run deficit)

## Day 2 - November 22, 2025

**Morning Session:**
England's second innings started positively, reaching 65/1 with a lead of 105. Then disaster struck. Scott Boland triggered a collapse, with England losing 4 wickets for just 11 runs in 19 balls. The tourists were reeling at 76/5.

**Afternoon Session:**
England lost 9 wickets for 99 runs during the middle session as Boland (4/33) and Starc (3/55) ripped through the batting order. Only Gus Atkinson (37) showed defiance as England were bowled out for 164, setting Australia a target of 205.

**Evening Session:**
Chasing 205, Australia got off to a flying start. Travis Head produced one of the greatest Ashes innings, smashing 123 off just 83 balls. His 69-ball century was the second-fastest in Ashes history. Marnus Labuschagne (51*) provided support as Australia raced to victory in just 28.2 overs.

**Result:** Australia won by 8 wickets

## Player of the Match

**Mitchell Starc** - 10 wickets for 113 runs (7/58 & 3/55) plus 10 runs with the bat

## Key Statistics

- **Fastest Ashes century:** Travis Head's 69-ball ton ranks as the 2nd fastest century in Ashes history
- **Two-day finish:** Only the 8th Test in history to finish inside two days
- **19 wickets on Day 1:** One of the most dramatic opening days in Ashes history
- **Mitchell Starc:** Career-best Test figures of 7/58

## Series Impact

Australia took a commanding 1-0 lead in the series with an emphatic victory. England's batting frailties were exposed on a lively Perth pitch, and their failure to capitalize on a 40-run first-innings lead proved costly. The margin of victory suggested Australia's dominance at home would continue.
